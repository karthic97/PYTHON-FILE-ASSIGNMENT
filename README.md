# YouTube Channel Data Analysis

## Short Description
This project examines YouTube channel data to discover insights such as the distribution of channel kinds and the top channels by subscriber count. It entails data loading, analysis, visualisation, and exporting filtered data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installing
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/karthic97/PYTHON-FILE-ASSIGNMENT
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib
    ```

## Running the Analysis
To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook file and execute the cells in order. This will perform the data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and exporting steps as described.

### Breakdown of Analysis

The analysis is organised into numerous stages, each carrying out distinct tasks:

1. Data Loading: - Load the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
    - The file path and data loading command are included in the notebook.

2. **Data Cleaning:** - Fill in missing values and drop them as needed.
    - To simplify the dataset, remove Â unrelated columns.

3. Data Analysis: - Determine the distribution of YouTube channel types.
    - Identify the top ten YouTube channels by subscriber count.
    - Conduct further appropriate analysis to gain insights from the data.

4. **Visualization:** - Use bar charts and other visualisations to show data distribution and analysis outcomes.
    - Use Matplotlib to plot the visualisations.

5. **Exporting Data:** - Export the filtered and analysed data into a new file for future use

## Deployment
To deploy this project,  the necessary dependencies installed and run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis.
